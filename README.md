## **ini's Notice**

This repository's goal is to archive at least MOST of the Community's ideas and findings featured on Twitter. 
The main format for archiving such content would be through saving the page as an HTML via the *"SingleFile"* addon, while also using another addon called *"OldTwitter"*.

The latter addon in particular allows for videos in Tweets to be loaded as something that can actually be saved as a video, and so the SingleFile addon can easily provide a link at the top left corner of the video preview that lets the user open the video in a new tab. The lack of a large empty space of nothing around the bottom portion of the page also makes OldTwitter much more favorable, as opposed to just using SingleFile on the regular Twitter website.

Both of these extensions in terms of their functions are crucial to archiving our Twitter posts inside the Werehog R&D Community page, so it's important for all members and anyone else to keep that in mind when contributing archived content of the Community.

Anyone that actually wishes to contribute to archiving needs to be at least familiar with commits, forks, pushes, and pulls. Familiarize yourself with how the process works in a nutshell, and I'd also recommend using *GitHub Desktop* just for ease of use (imo anyway!).

All that aside, I'll proceed updating this repo as time goes on. For now, I simply wanted to get a head start !! - ini
